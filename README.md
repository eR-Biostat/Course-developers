# The >eR-Biostat initiative:  course-developers
## Making R based education materials assessable for all

This repository contains information and online materials for people who would like to contribute/develop a course for the **>eR-Biostat** initiative.

All courses within the **>eR-Biostat** should be R based courses (i.e., all examples for data analysis are illustrated with R) and should be available online. 

## Course development

For each course, several types of course materials can be developed: 
* A book (or notes) if it can be available online.
* Slides for the course (PDF file with one slide per page).
* R programs, ready to use, which contain all data and R code for the all examples and illustrations discussed in the course.
* Homework assignments and exams.
* Videos tutorials.

## What can you download from this repository?

* A Tex file that can be used to produce slides for a course (example: slides for the class about simple linear regression). 
* Corresponding set of slides.
